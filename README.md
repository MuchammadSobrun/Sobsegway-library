To control BLDC Hover board motor with BLDC-8015A Wantai Driver motor.

This code are running by reading and executed serial command from PC, using  Arduino MEGA as microcontroller and BLDC-8015A as Driver Motor. the mission of this project is to control BLDC Hoverboard Wheel by sending serial data command from PC to microcontroller.

This code still under development, I am sorry if not perfect enough. if you have any questions please contact me atfalsobrun@gmail.com

Driver Motor pin (use):
- AVI (PWM)
- BRK (Break)
- ENABLE
- F/R (Direction)

Motor spec:
BLDC Hoverboard : U,V,W Power cable and HU,HW,HV Hall sensor

Microcontroller:
- Arduino MEGA
